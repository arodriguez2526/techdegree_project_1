      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I'm new to the world of coding, but wanted to do it for a long time now. In my yunger years I was aspiring to be a game developer as I sent hundreds if not thousands of hours playing the games I wished I had made.</p>
      <p>I've had many mediocre jobs and have been to different schoold after highschool, but never finished because it wasn't what I was looking for, mind you all they were all in the tehnical field. </p>
