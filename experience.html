    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>My experiences in this field are none, but have experience in others like:</p>
    <ul class="joblist">
      <li>Book Keeping</li>
      <li>Efficient in Excel</li>
      <li>Some Accounting</li>
      <li>Direct Support Personel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Out of all, the most that stands out to me is, Direct Support Personel; Where I worked with individuas with mental and physical disabilities. My main job there was to help these individuals find a job in their community, where they can grow as a person
      and in most cases help them be more independent. It also consisted in me training and finding ways for them to perform their required tasks to the best of their abilities. Not going to lie the pay wasn't great but I didn't care, the job in it's
      self was rewarding enough and I'm glad to say that I was able to help, assist, and encourge a lot of great people.
